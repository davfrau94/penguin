Working and practicing with CSS variables, animation and transform, building a penguin.

- HTML & CSS only
- Setting CSS variables with colors
- CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of the penguin and create a background.
- Animate the penguin on click (when active).
  
I made this project with FreeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn), and costumized a bit.
